              <p class="toJustify">
                  The assigned name of the project is “Cognitive rewiring through mixed reality”. The affiliated organisation is Microsoft whom require an application for their user Mark-Pollock. The project is designed to tackle the issue of correcting a user’s posture given the fact that they are visually impaired and paralyzed waist down. Virtual Therapy (Name of the application) is created in such a way, that it can be used alongside the current mechanism of a user correcting his/her position with the help of a psychiatrist. The application is trying to give the user more freedom by relying only on pleasant sound iterations to indicate if they are correctly aligned. The user-interface is developed in mind of further improvements by software engineers in order to provide a friendly interface when using the application, but also for the trainer/psychiatrist to start and stop the program if required so.

              <h3 class="mb-1">Client and User</h3>
              <p class="toJustify">
                  The group people part of this project and whom the solution is intended for are as follows: Jarnail Chudge – Client and Project Support, Mark Pollock – Client and Intended user, and finally Dimitry Sayenko – Subject matter expert. Through email communication and skype meetings, we were guided to the right path in terms of the correct technologies and intended hardware to be used for this project.

              <p>
                  In order to obtain client requirements we had used the method of email communication 
                  to obtain more knowledge of the project. Below we will talk about why chose this and why it was appropaite 
                  for our given situation. 
              </p>
              Why did we choose this?
              <ul>
                <li>Our client was situated in California</li>
                <li>
                    Questions and answers were delivered and responded to quickly
                </li>
                <li>
                  A record was kept of our communication and any misconcepts were handled
                  quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We were able to link (‘Cc’) other people related to the project for example our supervisor Simon.
                </li>
                <li> Below is an example of the questions we asked:</li>
              </ul>

                        Reasons for choosing this Initial Method
                        <ul class="toJustify">
                          <li> Due to no prior knowledge the questions had started of basic. This allowed us to gain an in-depth written answer from the client of what is expected</li>

              <p class="toJustify">
                  An online Questionnaire was sent to the Mark's physiatrist
                  to retrieve specfic information in order to create the solution that 
                  was required to help him. The information was valuable because as our project
                  would circulate around these requirements. Based on this we could focus on
                  certain joints of the human body opposed to the whole skeleton
                  which would have been beyond the scope of the project.

                  Questions were thought of prior to the interview. Upon setting this skype meetings
                  were set every fornite to update our client and user on our progress.
              </p>

              <p> Why did we choose this?</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Build a friendly and trustworthy relationship with the client</li>
                <li> Clear any doubts about current mock-requirements</li>
                <li> Clarify our budget, skills and what is do-able in the given time frame</li>
              </ul>

                  Sensors are a key aspect for our project. We required high quality ‘six degrees of freedom’ devices to retrieve the user’s position in 3D space. This is done in terms of coordinates and relative angles of joints. If the data received is not accurate enough, the overall feedback outputted to the user will have faults.

                      It is a promising motion track solution that uses magnetic sources to detect position of smaller devices mounted on the user’s joints. Data received from this sensor is in real time, and their experiments suggest that there is no latency. Also, occlusion does not represent a problem, because the main joints have individual sensors [1]. Occlusion is when one body parts including bones cover the joint, causing obscurity.
                      <br><br>
                      Although this is a good solution in terms of data precision, it is very expensive and exceeds our budged for the project. Furthermore, it requires a considerable amount of time to integrate with an external software so that it can produce 3D sounds.

The first disadvantage is represented by cost - 35,350 Euro is way beyond our budget. Secondly, it has a small delay in sending data by the method of wireless communication and the use of numerous cables. This would not be practical for the user.

                      Our supervisor Simon suggested these sensors as they are cheap and offer reasonable results when gathering joint position. The problem is that the only way they display real time data is by an android application developed by the company. There is no existing API hence making it hard to program as we require a continuous flow of body segments positions to be used in our own piece software for producing 3D sound.  Being composed from 6 sensors, it would be impossible for us to separately track all 20 joints that we need for calculating the pose of a user. Research also suggests that the sensor interferes with metallic surrounding thus obscuring results [3].

                      Kinect is a depth sensor created by Microsoft that outputs the skeleton position of a user in 3D space using the infrared light and RGB camera. It is a cheap and robust solution, with good documentation and online support. <b> We decided to go with Kinect,</b> because it offers the possibility of connecting with Unity. This part was vital for us because we needed a game engine or another piece software capable of producing mixed reality applications. Also, it provides a SDK that returns the position of up to 25 joints [4]. The device has very performant audio capturing function as well. This is an important aspect for designing a voice-command based user interface for visually impaired people. However, when compared with the previous solutions it does not offer such good results for occlusion. However, we can to try to reduce this impact by approximating position and inbuilt functions to filter data from interfered joints.

                  Unity is a game engine that has a great support for virtual reality applications. The biggest advantage is that Kinect has plugins for Unity. This makes it possible to transfer data from the real world to the virtual world. 
                  
                  <b> We have chosen Unity,</b> because it has great built in functions for creating immersive 3D sound feedback but also an accurate depth imager. The choice was also heavily affected by the large amount of documentation available for Unity and the support given on forums.

The structure of our data might change, based on the movement of the user. This means the relationship between joints and their number will differ a lot [7]. Also, we have a lot of relationships between the data which will mean introducing many new tables and linking them together in the most efficient manner.

We need to start the depth sensor when the unity application is run, get data from it, and stop it on user’s command [6]. For detecting the human body and accurate joint position from Kinect depth images, the NITE library is used.

As our application needs to initialise and stop the device, it contains drivers necessary for openNI and the kinect sensor. Also, it provides high level functions for using Kinect features.

It is a 2D machine learning, real time pose estimation library, where up to 18 body key points [9] are determined. This library yields great accuracy hence dealing well with occlusion. A rule-based algorithm can detect joint alignment just with 2D data, for example detect how bent the knees are without depth data, by calculating the relative position of angle joints.

                            However, we have not chosen this solution, because the creation of 3D audio feedback involves applying sound on objects in 3D space. Without the third axis, it is impossible to create objects that mimic our user and apply sound towards it from different directions. A solution to this problem would be the use of SMPLify.

This is required for the augmented part of our project causing problems as no documentation is provided on how to connect that avatar with real time streaming of data. This might be considered as an alternative solution in the future of the project, because SMPLify announced that they are working on creating a unity plugin. Therefore, the only big problem remaining is connecting the avatar to continuous data. However, this cannot be achieved as SMPLify only works on a single image [10]. It is worth mentioning that this library uses CNN (convolutional neuronal networks) suggesting that the computation costs for each image is high. Computing a continuous stream of images would not give real time results.
